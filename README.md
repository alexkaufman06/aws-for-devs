# AWS for Devs

This is documentation of my learnings from from the Linkedin course on [AWS for Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-amazon-web-services-aws-for-developers-2).

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

New accounts come with a root level user that has permissions to do everything including deleting the account.
  * So, it is best practice to another user and give that user permissions for administration access but it will not be able to delete the account
